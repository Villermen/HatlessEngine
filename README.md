# HatlessEngine


## Decription
HatlessEngine is a simple and easy to use 2D engine for C#.
I designed it with efficiency and easy of use in mind.
The reasons for making this engine are that I prefer coding abstract/complicated things over visual masterpieces.
There's still a lot to be done, and there will be done.
I've put it on github to have a backup and an easy way to show it to the people that care =)
