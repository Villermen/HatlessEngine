# HatlessEngine
An easy to use 2D game engine written in C# 

## Description
HatlessEngine is a simple and easy to use 2D engine for C#.
I designed it with ease of use and flexibility in mind.
The reasons for making this engine are that I prefer coding abstract/complicated things over visual masterpieces, and I like to find out what comes into play when making something on the backend side of things.
I've put it on github to have a backup and an easy way to show it to the people that care =)

## Features
 - Easy object and resource management.
 - Logging to file and/or console.
 - Built-in collision support.
 - Flatfile or code-based collections for easy setup of levels/situations.
 - Support for many different sound formats.
 - Streaming music.
 - A centralized way of checking input, and full gamepad support.
 - Viewports.
 - Nothing more than 'using HatlessEngine' required to get started on a game.

## Dependencies
HatlessEngine makes use of the following libraries:
 - [SDL2#](https://github.com/flibitijibibo/SDL2-CS) (A C# binding of the popular multimedia library [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/index.php)).

## Getting started
To use HatlessEngine for your project grab the binary from the latest release (coming soon?), or build it yourself from the source.
Add the dll to the references in your project and add `using HatlessEngine;` to any project file that needs to tap into the sweet Hatless juices.

For further help you can take a look at HatlessEngine's documentation (also coming soon I guess?).

Since this is a free library (please refer to the licence for amount of freeness) and a lot of love went into it, donations (PayPal: villermen@gmail.com) are always appreciated.
