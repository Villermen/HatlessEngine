# HatlessEngine

## Decription
HatlessEngine is a simple and easy to use 2D engine for C#.
I designed it with perfection and easy of use in mind.
The reasons for making this engine are that I prefer coding abstract/complicated things over visual masterpieces.
There's still a lot to be done, and there will be done.
I've put it on github to have a backup and an easy way to show it to the people that care =)

### Features
 - Easy object and resource management.
 - Logging to file and/or console.
 - Built-in collision support.
 - Flatfile or code-based collections for easy setup of levels.
 - Support for vorbis and wave sound.
 - Streaming music.
 - A central way of checking for input, and full gamepad support.
 - Multiple views.
 - Nothing more than 'using HatlessEngine' required to get started on a game.

HatlessEngine makes use of the following libraries:
 - [SDL2#](https://github.com/flibitijibibo/SDL2-CS) (A C# binding of the popular multimedia library [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/index.php)).
